<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO ME</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies Of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>THE BLACKLIST</h3>
<p>
  The movie is breathtaking with very intense plot twists that keeps you on the
  edge wondering what comes next. I consider it my favorite movie of all time.

<h3>BREAKING BAD</h3>
<p>
  An absolute brilliant masterpiece!! Breaking Bad is as good as everyone says
  it is. What sets it apart from most of the shows around is how close it is to
  reality.
</p>

<h3>GAME OF THRONES</h3>
<p>
  This is very likely the best TV show ever made in terms of suspense, character
  development, plot, effects, acting.....10/10 with no doubt.
